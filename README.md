## Question 4) Modelling Brownian motion 

### A

*A script for simulating a random walk is provided in the question-4-code folder of this repo. Execute the code to produce the paths of two random walks. What do you observe?*

My graphs:
![Random path plots](https://github.com/alanabrownn/reproducible-research_homework/blob/d6d8c58636597894642be6b6b1d60c837794695d/random_path_plots.png)
These graph are also stored in my `random_path_plots.png` file in this repo.

These graphs demonstrate Brownian motion in 2 dimensions. They each show a single particle which starts at the position vector (0,0), and then takes 500 steps of equal length (h=0.25) in a random direction. For each step, an angle between 0-2pi (360 degrees) is drawn according to a uniform random distribution, and because of this, each movement direction is independent from one another. The legend for these graph shows the time point at which each vector was obtained, and they are coloured in a gradient from black to blue to allow for easy visualization of the direction of movement. 

When comparing across the two graphs, you can see that there is a significant difference in the paths the particles take. The only similarity is that they both start at the origin, but from then on, the particle on the left graph largely stays in the negative x-coordinates (between -5 and 2), whereas the particle on the right graph mainly stays in the positive x-coordinates (-1 to 5). I also observe that the the path on the left graph is ultimately more circular with, after 500 time points, the particle finishing closer to the origin. In contrast, particle in the right graph ends up further away from the origin. Therefore, random movement generated in such a way could ultimately produce very different paths with very different destinations. 

### B 

*Investigate the term random seeds. What is a random seed and how does it work?*

When you ask a programming language to generate random numbers, although the output appears random and unpredictable, it is in fact only *pseudorandom*. They are instead being generated by an algorithm called *Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)*, whose output is determined by an initial value, known as the random-seed. Within code, you are able to set this random-seed at a specific value e.g. random.seed(23) prior to generating numbers. This sets the starting point of the algorithm to '23', and whilst the numbers generated following this imput are random, when you run the same seed again the output will be identical. Therefore, setting the random seeds allows for reproductability. When making alterations in your own code or somebody else's, you want to be sure that the changes *you* are making are impacting the results, and not the different set of numbers that are being randomly generated at the start. This technique is particularly useful in these circumstances. 

### C

*Edit the script to make a reproducible simulation of Brownian motion. Commit the file and push it to your forked reproducible-research homework repo.*

To make the Brownian motion simulation reproducible, I added the function set.seed() to my random_walk function. That way, every time I use this function to generate random moment, the same series of angles will be selected resulting in the same path. The input value I chose was 23. This is an arbitrary number which I selected for no particular reason. You can see how I applied this function by looking at the latest commit to the file `random_walk.R` in this repo, within the `question-4-code` file.

As expected, the graphs produced by this edited code are the same, thanks to set.seed():

This graph is also stored in my `reproducible_path_plots.png` file in this repo.

## Instructions

The homework for this Computer skills practical is divided into 5 questions for a total of 100 points (plus an optional bonus question worth 10 extra points). First, fork this repo and make sure your fork is made **Public** for marking. Answers should be added to the # INSERT ANSWERS HERE # section above in the **README.md** file of your forked repository.

Questions 1, 2 and 3 should be answered in the **README.md** file of the `logistic_growth` repo that you forked during the practical. To answer those questions here, simply include a link to your logistic_growth repo.

**Submission**: Please submit a single **PDF** file with your candidate number (and no other identifying information), and a link to your fork of the `reproducible-research_homework` repo with the completed answers. All answers should be on the `main` branch.

## Assignment questions 

1) (**10 points**) Annotate the **README.md** file in your `logistic_growth` repo with more detailed information about the analysis. Add a section on the results and include the estimates for $N_0$, $r$ and $K$ (mention which *.csv file you used).
   
2) (**10 points**) Use your estimates of $N_0$ and $r$ to calculate the population size at $t$ = 4980 min, assuming that the population grows exponentially. How does it compare to the population size predicted under logistic growth? 

3) (**20 points**) Add an R script to your repository that makes a graph comparing the exponential and logistic growth curves (using the same parameter estimates you found). Upload this graph to your repo and include it in the **README.md** file so it can be viewed in the repo homepage.
   
4) (**30 points**) Sometimes we are interested in modelling a process that involves randomness. A good example is Brownian motion. We will explore how to simulate a random process in a way that it is reproducible:

   - A script for simulating a random_walk is provided in the `question-4-code` folder of this repo. Execute the code to produce the paths of two random walks. What do you observe? (10 points)
   - Investigate the term **random seeds**. What is a random seed and how does it work? (5 points)
   - Edit the script to make a reproducible simulation of Brownian motion. Commit the file and push it to your forked `reproducible-research_homework` repo. (10 points)
   - Go to your commit history and click on the latest commit. Show the edit you made to the code in the comparison view (add this image to the **README.md** of the fork). (5 points)

5) (**30 points**) In 2014, Cui, Schlub and Holmes published an article in the *Journal of Virology* (doi: https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00362-14) showing that the size of viral particles, more specifically their volume, could be predicted from their genome size (length). They found that this relationship can be modelled using an allometric equation of the form **$`V = \beta L^{\alpha}`$**, where $`V`$ is the virion volume in nm<sup>3</sup> and $`L`$ is the genome length in nucleotides.

   - Import the data for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses taken from the Supplementary Materials of the original paper into Posit Cloud (the csv file is in the `question-5-data` folder). How many rows and columns does the table have? (3 points)
   - What transformation can you use to fit a linear model to the data? Apply the transformation. (3 points)
   - Find the exponent ($\alpha$) and scaling factor ($\beta$) of the allometric law for dsDNA viruses and write the p-values from the model you obtained, are they statistically significant? Compare the values you found to those shown in **Table 2** of the paper, did you find the same values? (10 points)
   - Write the code to reproduce the figure shown below. (10 points)
